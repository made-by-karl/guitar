## Usage in Guitar App

These samples are used to simulate various guitar percussion techniques:

- **Body Percussion**: Tapping and knocking on the guitar body for rhythmic effects
- **String Techniques**: Slapping, scratching, and muting strings for percussive sounds
- **Hardware Sounds**: Tapping on bridge, tuning pegs, and other metal components
- **Expressive Accents**: Adding emphasis and dynamic variation to guitar playing

## Technical Notes

- All samples maintain their original audio quality and dynamic markings
- Sample selection prioritizes sounds that closely match guitar percussion techniques
- File naming convention follows `guitar_[technique].mp3` for consistency
